This is a music discovery to application for Latin music. Explore music by genres or regions. Going on a trip to Cuba next summer? Check out songs from the Caribbean. Missing your college days studying abroad in España? Check out our Flamenco songs. Users can also upload their own songs so they can share their love of music!
